# gpSMART
A **g**eneral **p**urpose **S**tate **MA**chine **R**unner for **T**raining animal behaviors.

## Introduction
* [Bpod](https://github.com/sanworks/Bpod_StateMachine_Firmware) is an open-source software for real-time behaviour measurement. However, Bpod is running on an expensive hardware pod ($500+) and requires a PC ($500+) connected to it.
* This library enables **running behavioral state machine on an Arduino board ($30) and without PC ($0) in loop**. In addition to that, behavioral events are re-organized to fit a general purpose (see Features below).

## Features
* Constructing and runing behavioral state machine on the same Arduino board
* General-purpose events including digital I/O, soft events, global timer/counter, etc.
* Additional PWM channels for precise frequency and duty control
* Object-oriented programming

## Getting Started
* See the example code ``` gpSMART_Library.ino``` to learn how to use the library.
